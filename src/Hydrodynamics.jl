    update_hydrodynamics!(state::State, grid::Grid, data::HydrodynamicData, time::Float64)

Updates the hydrodynamic and environmental fields in the `state` object for the
current simulation `time`.

This is the core of the offline-coupling. It populates the state with placeholder
values for now, but is designed to be adapted to read from a NetCDF file.
